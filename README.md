### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,thanks for the visit!


## Let us build infrastructure and use cases for a better web 3.0

 Web 3.0 will bring us a fairer internet by enabling the individual to be a sovereign. True sovereignty implies owning and being able to control who profits from oneâ€™s time and information. Web 3.0â€™s decentralized blockchain protocol will enable individuals to connect to an internet where they can own and be properly compensated for their time and data, eclipsing an exploitative and unjust web, where giant, centralized repositories are the only ones that own and profit from it.
